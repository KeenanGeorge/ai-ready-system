# Cursor Rule â€” Branching & PRs

**Goal:** Always branch from `features`, use consistent names, and open PRs against `features` with Linear context.

## Branching
- **Base branch:** `features` (never `main`).
- **Branch name format:** `feature/<ISSUEKEY>-<slug>` (e.g., `feature/SMA-10-add-testmo`)
- **ISSUEKEYs allowed:** `SMA-\d+` or `ENG-\d+`
- **Slug:** lowercase, `-` separated, letters/numbers only.

## When creating a branch from an issue
1. Include the Linear issue key in the branch name.
2. Ensure base is `features`.
3. Commit messages start with the key, e.g., `SMA-10: integrate ...`
